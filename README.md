# mellow

This page is on github pages [here](https://deetonrushy.github.io/Vue-Trello-CL/).

Due to not having much experience with web design and architecture, I ended up making each component (class) 
handle its own state. So instead of its parent holding all of the ticket information,
it does.

This is why I ended up making the array of items, an array of meaningless integers.
I don't know how, or why that ended up being my choice, but it did.

It works, so I suppose it ain't too bad lol.
In short, I'm aware of the bad design choices, and will not make this
same mistake in the future.
